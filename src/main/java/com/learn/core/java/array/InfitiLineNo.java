 * 2. Given an infinite number line (from -INF to +INF)
 * A person starts from zero and initially has a step size of 1. After each step, the step size increases by 1. E.g. from 0, he can go to 1 or -1 with step size of 1. From 1 he can go to to -1 or 3 as the step size has become 2 now and so on.
 * Find minimum no. of steps to reach a given number N.
